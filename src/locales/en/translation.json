    "title": "About Us",
    "description": "It was just another ordinary day on campus. We sat at a small table tucked away in a quiet corner of the university cafÃ©. No grand plan. No intention to change the world. Just two people talking about life, people, and the possibility that technology could serve humanityâ€”not control it.\n\nBut the conversation slowly grew into something more. Based on stories we had lived or witnessed firsthand, an idea began to take shape. Not just an app, but a deep feeling that someone, somewhere, needed to feel understood, heard, and supported through their mental health journey.\n\nAnd from that moment, GRACE was born.\n\nGRACE is not just a digital platform. Itâ€™s a promiseâ€”a promise that no one should walk the path of healing alone. A belief that technology, when built with heart, can become a companion, a guide, a quiet supporter.\n\nWe began our journey with one simple but profound question: What if we could use artificial intelligence not just to analyze emotions, but to walk beside themâ€”until healing begins?\n\nOur team brought together developers, therapists, and human-centered designersâ€”people from different backgrounds, united by one goal: to create a platform that respects the human being before anything else. GRACE offers real tools: scientific assessments, intelligent cognitive interviews, personalized treatment plans, and well-designed exercises for recovery.\n\nWe believe privacy is not a feature, but a right. And that therapy should feel safe, human, and empowering.\n\nGRACE was built for those whoâ€™ve felt misunderstood. For those who longed to speak, but didnâ€™t know where to begin. And for anyone who still believes healing is possibleâ€”if someone simply shows the way.\n\nWe are GRACE. We donâ€™t promise perfection, but we promise to walk with you, every step of the way.",
