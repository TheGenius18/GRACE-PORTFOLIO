      <p className="text-2xl">
        GRACE was born from a simple yet powerful belief: that everyone deserves
        access to compassionate, intelligent, and personalized mental health
        support — no matter where they are in life. Our journey began with a
        question: What if technology could not only understand how we feel, but
        guide us toward healing? From this vision, GRACE was created — a mental
        health platform designed to help individuals understand, manage, and
        overcome depression through a thoughtful combination of human care and
        AI-powered tools. We value empathy, privacy, and dignity.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Every feature in GRACE — from the AI-based depression diagnosis to
        therapist-led sessions and personalized training exercises — is built to
        empower users with insight, choice, and trust. At GRACE, we don’t
        believe in one-size-fits-all. We believe in meeting you where you are,
        with tools that evolve with you. Whether you're seeking clarity, a
        connection with a professional, or simply a moment of peace <br></br>
        <br></br>— GRACE is here to walk beside you, every step of the way.
